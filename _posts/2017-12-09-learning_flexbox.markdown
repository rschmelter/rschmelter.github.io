Flexbox is a relatively new way to add responsiveness to a website. It’s not a part of the Flatiron curriculum at this point, and I believe it’s yet to enjoy broad browser support. However, I took some time to learn it (at least a little), and I’m glad did. I can definitely see why it will be used more and more going forward. For this entry, I thought I’d do a cursory overview of flexbox’s capabilities and benefits.

At the core of flexbox is setting separate properties in CSS for HTML containers and all children of those containers. Once you’ve set the container to flex in CSS, you can easily make significant adjustments to the container’ children with minimal code. For example, you can set the direction of the content, justification, and alignment, apply wrap behavior, and much more. 

Flexbox also allows you to easily modify the appearance and position of the children of a container directly. For instance, flex-grow is a property you can use to ensure a certain child element is always exactly a certain size larger than its siblings – again with just one line of code. 

At first, one of my favorite aspects of flexbox was that it could be used in place of floats, which require more consideration and, I’ve found, lead to some odd behavior sometimes. However, diving into it more, I’m seeing how powerful this tool is in giving developers the flexibility to quickly and easily position elements on a page. Here’s an excellent resource I used to get started: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ .
