When you want to know how things work, it can be very annoying when you don't. My first experience with this was as a third grader, taking apart a broken calculator. Sitting at the table with a small pile of electronic innards, all streaked with lines like a map that led nowhere, I was at a loss. Fortunately for me, I was performing this dissection around someone who knew a thing or two about electronics. Unfortunately for me, I would have to learn that questions like "what is this" and "how does this work" tend to lead down an infinite rabbit hole of "ok but what is *this*" and "ok then, but how does *that* work?" 

I'm embarrassed to admit that I still don't know how that calculator worked. Not really. But I can trace most of my life's pursuits to those stubborn moments when answers to "how does this work?" simply weren't good enough.

Another thing happens when you want to know how things work is that everything becomes interesting. Nothing is boring because nothing is too obscure to be part of the larger whole - the bigger picture. And if I learned one thing when taking apart a calculator, it was that to really understand a thing - anything - was to understand everything. A calculator could not be divorced from all the laws of physics. Nor could it be separated from the conditions of a society that finds it useful. These rabbit holes are deep.

Of course, to understand everything is no small feat, and at some point we accept that some separation of labor and responsibilities may be necessary. Still, I wanted to know that I always had my eye on the bigger picture - that I was in some way contributing to a better understanding of how things worked. So I became a writer and a teacher. This allowed me to think in broad terms and pursue knowledge wherever I found interest. I learned to always consider the foundation of whatever subject I explored. 

Where does coding come in to this? For years I was surrounded by technology that was integral to everything I explored and produced. That I am able to quickly find resources for nearly any subject imaginable is not something I ever took for granted. Technology was the set of tools underpinning nearly all of my pursuits, and for me there was no question that those pursuits were worth undertaking. So naturally, it bothered me that I didn't know how these tools worked.

Although I had always maintained a fascination with new technologies and thought about the ways they might best be used, I knew that until I learned to understand and use them, I wouldn't be able to contribute to improving them in a meaningful way. Breaking into a brand-new field can be overwhelming, and so, maybe too prudently, I began learning slowly. Perhaps my favorite realization early on in this process was that there would never be a shortage of new things to learn and ways to improve. I was happy to learn quickly that, in coding, I'd never be able to ask "how does this work?" enough times. A deep dive is the only solution.

Certainly, I hope that over the coming months, I become a competent and employable developer. But more importantly, I hope to one day find myself in a position in which I can contribute something meaningful to this field. To create tools that people around the world, though they may not understand how they work, find incredibly useful.
