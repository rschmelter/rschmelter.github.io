My first job out of college was as a copywriter and coordinator with a commercial lighting company that wanted to create an ecommerce website to sell residential lighting. As we discussed what our strategy would be going forward, the owners would routinely refer to a way to “magically” import spreadsheets with information on different types of lighting and have it display nicely on the site. I certainly had no idea how this process would work, but it struck me that these people, a group of engineers, who routinely fixed lighting fixtures on their own in the shop would refer to creating a website as “magic”. 

Diving into object orientation, I can’t help but be relieved to find that these programs are designed to model real-world scenarios. More so, I’m surprised that I would have thought it happened any other way. Creating classes that define behaviors and enabling them to create individual objects, which can, in turn, interact with other objects, has helped take a lot of the mystery out what’s been happening behind my screen all of these years. No magic required. 

However, these models have me simultaneously wary of and excited to see what we’ll be able to achieve with advancements. After all, deriving objects from classes with a set of discrete behaviors is certainly useful, but it only models the real word up to a point. I can’t imagine what it would be to define a Person class that actually accommodated all the potential behaviors of an actual person, let alone capture the real complexity of such an instance interacting with many other, equally complex, instances. Of course, this is hardly necessary to make a program useful that, for example, schedules an appointment. But as our capabilities advance, I can only imagine the number of edge cases we’ll need to account for.
