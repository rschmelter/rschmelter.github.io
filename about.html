<p>I am a copywriter and former high school teacher at the start of a lifelong pursuit of mastering software development and using it to help create positive change. I have a strong interest in new technologies and their power to shape the future. The purpose of this blog is to probe at my evolution as a coder as it unfolds, hopefully revealing some insights into the relationship between my coding education, my goals as a developer, and what I ultimately produce. </p>
